        In this web project, we offer the artisan a commercial space, as well as mediation between them and the buyers.

        The objective is the possibility of offering a unique product and at the same time bringing small entrepreneurs closer to an online market,
        offering them more visibility and at the same time they can capture more benefits in exchange for the unique works that are increasingly in demand
        by tired buyers of repetitive products from large markets.
